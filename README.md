## Roadmap
- Integrate server-side database for Contact form, instead of hacky work-around Google Sheet solution (see [here](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server) for what I am using currently)
- Improve mobile display (fix spacing issues, better adjustment to screen size, etc.)
